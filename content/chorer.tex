The project centers around ChorEr, a Proof of Concept for a static analyzer developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis at the University of Bologna \cite{genovese2023chorer}. This tool is implemented in Erlang and is openly available under the GPLv3 license on GitHub \cite{website:chorer}. ChorEr generates multiple DOT files (a commonly employed graph description language) representing Choreography Automata of a given Erlang program's local and global views.
