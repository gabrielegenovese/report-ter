abstract="We generalise a theory of multiparty session types for the $\pi$-calculus through asynchronous communication subtyping, which allows partial commutativity of actions with maximal flexibility and safe optimisation in message choreography. A sound and complete algorithm for the subtyping relation, which can calculate conformance of optimised end-point processes to an agreed global specification, is presented. As a complementing result, we show a type inference algorithm for deriving the principal global specification from end-point processes which is minimal with respect to subtyping. The resulting theory allows a programmer to choose between a top-down and a bottom-up style of communication programming, ensuring the same desirable properties of typable processes.",

abstract = {Choreographies are global descriptions of interactions among concurrent components, most notably used in the settings of verification and synthesis of correct-by-construction software. They require a top-down approach: programmers first write choreographies, and then use them to verify or synthesize their programs. However, most software does not come with choreographies yet, which prevents their application. To attack this problem, previous work investigated choreography extraction, which automatically constructs a choreography that describes the behavior of a given set of programs or protocol specifications.We propose a new extraction methodology that improves on the state of the art: we can deal with programs that are equipped with state and internal computation; time complexity is dramatically better; and we capture programs that work by exploiting asynchronous communication.},
