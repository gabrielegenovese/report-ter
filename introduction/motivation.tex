The primary motivation behind this research project is to explore the choreography and choreography automata framework, making it more aligned with the needs of developers, through tools that enable choreography extraction. The tool not only facilitates the visualization and understanding of concurrent systems but also serves as a practical implementation that demonstrates how the abstract concepts of choreographies can be applied to existing technologies. This approach can provide several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Debugging: developers can use the tool to gain insights into the global and local behaviors of their concurrent programs;
    \item Verification of concurrency models: it offers a mechanism to verify that the program's implementation aligns with the intended choreography, ensuring correctness and reducing potential synchronization errors.
    % \item Industry Adoption: showing how theoretical constructs can improve real-world programming workflows
\end{itemize}
